							My Close Friend

It was around 11 PM when I was playing The Strongest Battlegrounds. I fought someone really strong, 
and it was one of the most fun matches I’d ever had. His Roblox display name was Kia, and his username was Samyog1299. 
After that fight, I added him on Roblox.
At that time, the game Grow A Garden was very popular. I started playing it for a while, and one day, Kia joined me!
I didn’t realize how rich he was in that game. From my point of view, it was impressive. 
I had a Raccoon pet that a friend from school gave me. 
If you don’t know, the Raccoon can duplicate fruits from other player's gardens.
Kia had a really good fruit in his garden, so I asked if I could use my Raccoon to duplicate his fruits. He said yes.
Then I asked another question: “Can we tend?”
In that game, tending means giving each other something called a Friendship Pot.
You place it in your garden, and both of you visit every day to tend it.
So we did that, every single day. It was so much fun.
One day, Kia asked for my contact info. I gave him my Discord and Instagram. 
We kept playing games together every day. He asked my age; I told him. Then I asked his, he was 2–3 years older than me
and already in college.
Time passed. We kept doing the same things, but slowly, the games we played started to feel repetitive and boring. 
Still, we tended our Friendship Pot, all the way up to day 98. On day 99, he forgot, and I was busy that day too.
After that, our friendship started to fade. We played less and less, and it felt like things were slowly falling apart.
One day, he asked me to play The Strongest Battlegrounds again, the game where we first met. 
Then he told me he was going to sell his account.
I asked him why.
He said, “For money.”
I understood him. I even asked if I could buy his account, not to change the password, 
but just so that if he ever wanted to play again, he still could. Maybe that was selfish… 
but I just wanted a reason for us to play together again someday.
Now, at the present time (October 31, 2025)

Thank you, Pax.
